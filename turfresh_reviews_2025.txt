This is the best company I have found that really keeps the dog urine under control. I use the Liquid Bio X product once every 2-3 weeks on my artificial lawn. I like to use the granular two or three times a year and the liquid more regularly. I also have the maintenance three times a year and Leo, the best tech ever, comes out and really takes the time to do my lawn the proper way and it smells great when he’s done and it lasts a long time. Leo is also very courteous and respectful of my family, my dogs and my property. He always keeps the gates shut as I have three big dogs.Don’t waste your time or money on other products because I’ve tried them all and this is hands-down the best product

We have subscribed to the TurFresh renewal service once every 4 months. Their services comprised of raking up your blades of grass and placing new odor counteractant beads under the blades, as well as pulling all of the weeds that have grown in and around your turf. Lastly, they spray a generous amount of their proprietary and highly effective odor counteractant enzyme spray all through the turf which has a 30-day warranty for smells.We have a great day and another medium-sized dog so the smells can get quite overpowering But their treatment leaves a Nice fresh scent that lasts for weeks if not months. I would highly recommend TurFresh . To anyone with artificial turf that wants it to look refreshed as well as getting rid of unwanted odors.

I waited to post my review until after it rained and we just experienced a substantial amount. We have a big dog and had been experiencing a very strong urine odor for days after it rains. I'm extremely impressed that there has been no odor at all since having our turf cleaned by Aaron about 3 weeks ago. We also smell a nice clean scent in the air every so often. I highly recommend if you have pets.

Our turf tech that did the service today was Luis and he is outstanding! He is experienced, knowledgeable, friendly, & punctual. We signed up for the 6 month maintenance schedule and if he is not assigned to our house, I hope they are all as good as him!! Thanks Luis for the fresh clean turf. What an awesome difference!

I was skeptical this would work since we had tried so many things to get rid of the smell on our turf, but this did the trick!The tech listened very patiently to our issues and explained how the whole process would work. He also left us some product to upkeep the turf.Couldn’t recommend this enough. It’s a little pricey, but worth it if you have a smell you can’t get rid of.

Very happy with the turf cleaning service. Our lawn serviceman, Jesus, was so kind and I was amazed by his work. My turf is almost 10 years old and he made it look brand new. I have a dog too and my yard was looking pristine and had no more urine smells either. It’s been about 2 weeks since the cleaning and it still smells great. But most importantly, I really appreciate the amazing customer service. From scheduling and cleaning service, I’m so happy with my experience! I will definitely be using TurFresh again!

What a find! I’ve been looking for a way to effectively clean and deodorize the turf in my backyard for a while. The turf is seven years old and used daily by three dogs. Jonathon from TurFresh cleaned and deodorized the turf in about 3 hrs. The odor is gone and the turf looks great. I’ll definitely use the service again and again!

Wow, we’re so impressed with this company! After a bit of research we decided to go with TurFresh for our backyard. Within minutes of reaching out they responded with estimates and availability. I had to reschedule a few times and they were accommodating and met all our needs.On the day of service, Dean was attentive, thorough, and clean. He left the backyard looking and smelling brand new! He was able to pinpoint and address the areas where our dog left the most “mess”.Our total cost ended up being LESS than the estimate. We highly recommend this company!FYI: Our turf is approx 3 years old. This was our first professional full-cleaning. We have one large dog who uses the backyard.

We have two small dogs and live in Henderson. We installed “pet-friendly” turf, but within six months, our yard smelled like a zoo despite trying every product sold to the public to get rid of the odor.So, we decided to hire someone to help manage the problem. After doing a bunch of research, we chose TurFresh because of their pricing, membership discounts, and commitment to using pet and eco-friendly products.Cannot believe the difference after just one treatment. Whenever I sprayed my yard with an enzyme product, it always made the smell worse. Now, the “grass” looks brand new, and the smell is completely gone. TurFresh is very punctual, friendly, and thorough. We finally found an answer to our odor problem!
